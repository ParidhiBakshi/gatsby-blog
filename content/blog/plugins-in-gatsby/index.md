Netlify CMS is a React single page app for editing git based content via API. Its built for non-technical and technical editors alike, and its super easy to install and configure. For more details, check out the [docs site](https://netlifycms.org/).

**Note:** `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms@^4.0.0` changes the requirement for Netlify CMS to use a new library published `netlify-cms-app@^2.9.x` and is a **breaking change**.
